            Rel was born on July 9, 1949 in Trieste, Italy to Gioacchino and Maria Delbello. In 1957, he and his parents
            immigrated to Canada, settling in Coaldale. He grew up in Lethbridge and graduated from Catholic Central
            High
            School
            in 1968. Rel was a CCH Cougar athlete throughout his high school years, playing on both the basketball and
            football
            teams. From 1969-1973, he attended Minot State University in North Dakota, where he played football and
            obtained
            a
            Bachelor of Science in Physical Education.

            Rel enjoyed a 35-year-long career in the Holy Spirit Catholic School Division, primarily teaching at his
            alma
            mater,
            Catholic Central High School. Rel also rejoined the CCH Cougars football team from 1975-1983 as their Head
            Coach.
            During his tenure, Rel and his long-time friend and colleague, Rick Credico, led the team to several
            championships.
            After retiring from teaching in 2009, Rel spent the following three years working with students in the
            Registered
            Apprenticeship Program through CAREERS: The Next Generation.

        <p>
            Between 1990 and 1992, Rel co-authored the “Century 21 Accounting: Third Canadian Edition” textbook, along
            with
            related workbooks and guides. Today, his textbook is still used in classrooms to prepare students for a
            career
            in
            accounting and to educate businesses in basic accounting practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            Rel’s hobbies and interests reflected his deep love for his children. He loved sharing his passion for
            sports
            with
            them and could be found behind the bench as their coach or in the stands as their biggest cheerleader. Rel
            took
            a
            keen interest in videography, mainly in order to capture every moment with his family. On vacation, he would
            be
            reliably recording with the latest video camera in hand. Finally, Rel had a love of sweets (and ice cream in
            particular), sharing his secret stashes with his children.

        <p>
            Rel is predeceased by his parents, Gioacchino and Maria, and brother, Marino.
